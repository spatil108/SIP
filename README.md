This application will make call to a destination URI specified in the command line argument, and establish audio communication with remote party once the call is connected.

Below is the procedure, how to run the program, but if throws an error of pjsua import error and you are having trouble installing pjsua, you need to install the dependancies and install the pjsua library.

Now you can call another softphone (such as â€‹pjsua) by specifying the SIP URI as command line argument. For example, if the other softphone is on "sip:192.168.0.15:5080", run the program as follows:

 python simplecall.py sip:192.168.0.15:5080
